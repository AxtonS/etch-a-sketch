# etch-a-sketch
This is my second javascript project  
It currently only supports mouse or trackpad, will not work on touchscreen like on phones or tablets.  
Try it out at: https://axtons.github.io/etch-a-sketch/  

Work in progress:  

-Build function to gradually darken squares on subsequent passes until black  
-Add button to change between white/black and rgb mode
